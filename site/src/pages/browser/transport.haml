    h4. Network errors

    As explained in the "architecture documentation":/architecture.html, the
    Faye client does not talk to the network directly but uses a 'transport'
    object based on WebSocket, XMLHttpRequest, and other network APIs.

    The client exposes an abstract interface for checking the status of
    whichever connection type is in use, which is useful for giving the user
    feedback about the connection, or making your application deal with being
    offline. You can listen to the @transport:up@ and @transport:down@ events to
    be notified that the client is online or offline.

    <pre class="prettyprint">client.bind('transport:down', function() {
      // the client is offline
    });

    client.bind('transport:up', function() {
      // the client is online
    });</pre>

    Note that these events _do not_ reflect the status of the client's session,
    or whether there is literally a network connection active. For example, you
    are not told that the transport is down just because a long-polling request
    just completed. The transport is only considered down if a request or
    WebSocket connection explicitly fails, or times out, indicating the server
    is unreachable.

    Also remember that Faye deals with buffering and re-sending messages for you,
    so you don't need to deal with that. These events are simply for providing
    feedback on the health of the connection.

    The client will also trigger a @state@ event whenever the client state changes.
