    h4. Setting up
    
    In order to use the browser client, you'll need to start up a Faye
    server to handle message delivery between clients. See the
    "Node.js":/node.html or "Ruby":/ruby.html documentation for more
    information.
    
    With the server up and running, you just need to include the
    client script in your page. Let's assume you've mounted a server
    at @http://localhost:8000/faye@.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint"><script type="text/javascript"
            src="http://localhost:8000/faye.js">
            </script></pre>
    
    You can then create a client. You should make sure you only create
    one client per target server, since browsers impose a per-host connection
    limit and creating more clients will saturate the available connections
    in many browsers.
    
    To make a client, all you need is the mount point of the server you
    want to connect to:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint"><script type="text/javascript">
        var client = new Faye.Client('http://localhost:8000/faye');
    </script></pre>
    
    h4. Timeouts
    
    You can optionally specify a timeout; if the server does not send back
    any data for the given period of time, the client will assume the
    server has gone away and will attempt to reconnect. Specify the timeout
    as follows:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint"><script type="text/javascript">
        var client = new Faye.Client('http://localhost:8000/faye', {
            timeout: 120
        });
    </script></pre>
    
    The timeout is given in seconds and should be larger that the timeout
    you set up on the server side, so we give the server ample time to
    respond before assuming there's been a network error.
    
    h4. Cross-domain operation
    
    Faye clients and servers transparently support cross-domain communication,
    so your client can connect to a server on any domain you like without
    further configuration.
    
    h4. Disabling specific transports
    
    For some applications you may need to exclude some transports from use. For
    example you may know your deployment environment cannot support WebSockets,
    or you have reasons to stick to polling. In such situations you can disable
    a transport like so:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">client.disable('websocket');</pre>
    
    You can disable any transport, but bear in mind some transports are
    essential for establishing a connection so disabling them can render the
    client useless. These mandatory transports are:
    
    * *@long-polling@* - Based on @XMLHttpRequest@, used for same-domain
      connections
    * *@callback-polling@* - Based on JSON-P, used for cross-domain connections
    * *@in-process@* - used for server-side clients in the same process as the
      server
    
    h4. Turning off auto-disconnect
    
    When running in a web browser, the client listens to the @beforeunload@
    event and sends a disconnection message to the server. If this message is
    not sent, the server will eventually clean up the client's data due to
    inactivity, but having clients explicitly disconnect helps reduce the work
    the periodic garbage collection has to do.
    
    If this behaviour causes problems for your application, you can stop the
    client automatically disconnecting like so:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">client.disable('autodisconnect');</pre>
