    h4. Server-side Node.js clients

    You can use Faye clients on the server side to send messages to in-browser
    clients or to other server-side processes. The API is identical to the
    "browser client":/browser.html.

    To create a client, just supply the host you want to connect to:

    <pre class="prettyprint">var client = new faye.Client('http://localhost:8000/faye');</pre>

    You can then use @client.subscribe()@ and @client.publish()@ to send
    messages to other clients; see the "browser client":/browser.html
    documentation for more information.

    The server has its own client attached to it so you can use the server to
    send messages to browsers. This client has direct access to the server
    without going over HTTP, and is thus more efficient. To send messages
    through the server just use the @#getClient()@ method.

    <pre class="prettyprint">bayeux.getClient().publish('/email/new', {
      text:       'New email has arrived!',
      inboxSize:  34
    });</pre>
