    h3. Node.js server
    
    h4. Setting up
    
    All Faye clients need a central messaging server to communicate with;
    the server records which clients are subscribed to which channels
    and handles routing of messages between clients. Setting up a server
    under Node.js is simple:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var faye = require('./path/to/faye-node');
    
    var server = new faye.NodeAdapter({
      mount:    '/faye',
      timeout:  45
    });
    
    // Handle non-Bayeux requests
    server.addListener('passthrough', function(request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.write('Hello, non-Bayeux request');
      response.end();
    });
    
    server.listen(8000);</pre>
    
    The @NodeAdapter@ class supports these options during setup:
    
    * @mount@: the path on the host at which the Faye service is available.
      In this example, clients would connect to @http://localhost:8000/faye@
      to talk to the server.
    * @timeout@: the maximum time to hold a connection open before
      returning the response. This is given in seconds and must be smaller
      than the timeout on your frontend webserver.
    
    h4. Notes
    
    A note about the mount point: mounting the server at @/faye@ will make
    the Faye server respond to any request whose path begins @/faye@; this
    is so that it can interoperate with clients that use different request
    paths for different channels.
    
    To allow browser clients to connect to the server, make sure you
    have @faye-node.js@ and @faye-browser-min.js@ in the same directory.
    
    h4. Server-side Node.js clients
    
    You can use Faye clients on the server side to send messages to
    in-browser clients or to other server-side processes. The API is
    identical to the "browser client":/browser.html.
    
    To create a client, just supply the host you want to connect to:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var client = new faye.Client('http://localhost:8000/faye');</pre>
    
    You can then use @client.subscribe()@ and @client.publish()@ to
    send messages to other clients; see the "browser client":/browser.html
    documentation for more information.
    
    The server has its own client attached to it so you can use the
    server to send messages to browsers. This client has direct access
    to the server without going over HTTP, and is thus more efficient.
    To send messages through the server just use the @#getClient()@ method.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">server.getClient().publish('/email/new', {
      text:       'New email has arrived!',
      inboxSize:  34
    });</pre>
    
    h4. Extensions
    
    Both the server and client support an extension mechanism that lets
    you intercept messages as they pass in and out. This lets you
    modify messages for any purpose you like, including messages on
    @/meta/*@ channels that are used by the protocol. An extension is
    just an object that has either an @incoming()@ or @outgoing()@ method
    (or both). These methods should accept a message and a callback
    function, and should call the function with the message once they
    have made any modifications.
    
    Extensions use a callback instead of simply returning the modified
    message since this allows you to use asynchronous logic to make
    your modifications.
    
    As an example, suppose we want to authenticate subscription messages
    by checking an authentication token against a list we're keeping
    in a file on disk. Clients subscribe to channels by sending a
    message to the @/meta/subscribe@ channel with the channel they want
    to subscribe in the @subscription@ field. Let's say our authentication
    file contains a JSON object that maps channels to required tokens:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">// tokens.json
    
    {
      "/users/jcoglan/updates": "rt6utrb",
      "/artists/mclusky/news":  "99taaec"
    }</pre>
    
    The server can validate subscription messages by checking that
    they have the right auth token attached. By convention, data
    added by extensions is stored in the message's @ext@ field.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var fs = require('fs');
    
    var serverAuth = {
      incoming: function(message, callback) {
        // Let non-subscribe messages through
        if (message.channel !== '/meta/subscribe')
          return callback(message);
        
        // Get subscribed channel and auth token
        var subscription = message.subscription,
            msgToken     = message.ext && message.ext.authToken;
        
        // Find the right token for the channel
        fs.readFile('./tokens.json', function(err, content) {
          var registry = JSON.parse(content.toString()),
              token    = registry[subscription];
          
          // Add an error if the tokens don't match
          if (token !== msgToken)
            message.error = 'Invalid subscription auth token';
          
          // Call the server back now we're done
          callback(message);
        });
      }
    };
    
    server.addExtension(serverAuth);</pre>
    
    If you add an @error@ property to a message, the server will not
    process the message further and will simply return it to the
    sender, effectively blocking the subscription attempt. You should
    always make sure your extension calls the @callback@, as failing
    to do so could block delivery of other messages in the same request.
    
    On the client side, you'll need to make sure the client sends
    the right auth token to satisfy the server. We do this by adding
    an _outgoing_ extension on the client side.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">var clientAuth = {
      outgoing: function(message, callback) {
        // Again, leave non-subscribe messages alone
        if (message.channel !== '/meta/subscribe')
          return callback(message);
        
        // Add ext field if it's not present
        if (!message.ext) message.ext = {};
        
        // Set the auth token
        message.ext.authToken = 'rt6utrb';
        
        // Carry on and send the message to the server
        callback(message);
      }
    };
    
    client.addExtension(clientAuth);</pre>
    
    If an extension has an @added()@ method, that will be called when
    the extension is added to its host. To remove an extension, call:
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">// Calls extension.removed() if defined
    hostObject.removeExtension(extension);</pre>
    
    To write extensions you'll need to know what kinds of messages are
    used by the Bayeux protocol; see "the specification":http://svn.cometd.com/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html
    for more details.
