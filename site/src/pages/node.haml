    h4. Setting up

    All Faye clients need a central messaging server to communicate with; the
    server records which clients are subscribed to which channels and handles
    routing of messages between clients. Setting up a server in Node.js is
    simple:

    <pre class="prettyprint">var http = require('http'),
        faye = require('faye');

    var server = http.createServer(),
        bayeux = new faye.NodeAdapter({mount: '/faye', timeout: 45});

    bayeux.attach(server);
    server.listen(8000);</pre>

    The @NodeAdapter@ class supports these options during setup:

    * *@mount@* - the path on the host at which the Faye service is available.
      In this example, clients would connect to @http://localhost:8000/faye@ to
      talk to the server. The server will handle _any_ request whose path begins
      with the @mount@ path; this is so that it can interoperate with clients
      that use different request paths for different channels.
    * *@timeout@* - the maximum time to hold a connection open before returning
      the response. This is given in seconds and must be smaller than the
      timeout on your frontend webserver.
    * *@engine@* - (optional) the type and parameters for the engine you want to
      use - see the "engines documentation":/node/engines.html
    * *@ping@* - (optional) how often, in seconds, to send keep-alive ping
      messages over WebSocket and EventSource connections. Use this if your Faye
      server will be accessed through a proxy that kills idle connections.

    Faye should be attached to an existing HTTP server using the @attach()@
    method. It will handle all requests to paths matching the @mount@ path and
    delegate all other requests to your handlers.

    <pre class="prettyprint">var http = require('http'),
        faye = require('faye');

    var bayeux = new faye.NodeAdapter({mount: '/faye', timeout: 45});

    // Handle non-Bayeux requests
    var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.write('Hello, non-Bayeux request');
      response.end();
    });

    bayeux.attach(server);
    server.listen(8000);</pre>
