    h3. Download Faye
    
    The latest version is 0.8.0, released February 26 2012. It is open-source
    software, released under the MIT license. You can follow development on
    Faye's "GitHub page":http://github.com/faye/faye.
    
    h4. Download for Node.js and web browsers
    
    The Node.js version is available through "npm":http://npmjs.org/. This
    package contains a copy of the browser client, which is served up by the
    Faye server when running.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">npm install faye</pre>
    
    Alternatively you can grab the latest release package:
    
    <a href="/assets/faye.0-8-0.zip" onclick="trackDownload('0.8.0')">
      Download JavaScript version 0.8.0
    </a>
    
    The above package contains two files:
    
    * @faye-node.js@
    * @faye-browser-min.js@
    
    To use Faye for Node.js, just put these two files together in a directory,
    and load the server-side component using @require('./path/to/faye-node')@.
    The @faye-browser-min.js@ file contains the web browser client, which your
    Faye server will serve for you automatically.
    
    The browser client can be used standalone with other Bayeux servers like
    "CometD":http://cometd.org - just include @faye-browser-min.js@ in your web
    page to use it.
    
    h4. Download for Ruby
    
    For Ruby platforms, Faye is easily installable through RubyGems.
    
    <pre class="prettyprint">gem install faye</pre>
    
    This package also includes the browser client which is served up by the Faye
    server when running.
