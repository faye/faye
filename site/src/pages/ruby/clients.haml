    h4. Server-side Ruby clients

    You can use Faye clients on the server side to send messages to in-browser
    clients or to other server-side processes. The API is identical to the
    "browser client":/browser.html.

    To create a client, just supply the host you want to connect to:

    <pre class="prettyprint">client = Faye::Client.new('http://localhost:9292/faye')</pre>

    You can then use @client.subscribe()@ and @client.publish()@ to send
    messages to other clients; the API is similar to the "browser client":/browser.html
    only you need to run the client inside EventMachine:

    <pre class="prettyprint">require 'eventmachine'

    EM.run {
      client = Faye::Client.new('http://localhost:9292/faye')

      client.subscribe('/foo') do |message|
        puts message.inspect
      end

      client.publish('/foo', 'text' => 'Hello world')
    }</pre>

    Note that the Ruby client uses @EventMachine::Deferrable@ instead of
    "promises":http://promisesaplus.com/, for example you detect success and
    failure of a publication like so:

    <pre class="prettyprint">publication = client.publish('/foo', 'text' => 'Hello world')

    publication.callback do
      puts 'Message received by server!'
    end

    publication.errback do |error|
      puts 'There was a problem: ' + error.message
    end</pre>

    If you need to set custom headers to talk to your Bayeux server, use the
    @set_header@ method:

    <pre class="prettyprint">client.set_header('Authorization', 'OAuth abcd-1234')</pre>

    The server has its own client attached to it so you can use the server to
    send messages to browsers. This client has direct access to the server
    without going over HTTP, and is thus more efficient. To send messages
    through the server just use the @#get_client@ method.

    <pre class="prettyprint">bayeux.get_client.publish('/email/new', {
      'text'      => 'New email has arrived!',
      'inboxSize' => 34
    })</pre>
